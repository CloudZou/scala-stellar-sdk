# Stellar SDK for Scala

The Scala SDK for the [Stellar network](https://www.stellar.org/) provides an API to:

* Create accounts
* Build and submit transactions
* Query network state from Horizon
* Stream network updates from Horizon [Pending]
* Query federation servers [Pending]


## Benefits

A Scala developer would choose this SDK over the Java SDK because:

* `Option`s, not nulls
* `Try`s, not exceptions
* `Future`s for all network operations
* Encapsulation of paged responses into `Stream`s
* Case classes instead of builder patterns
* Explicit type hierarchies instead of meaningful primitives
* Test coverage: Generative testing using scalacheck with the goal of 100% coverage
* Perform network operations on the terminal through the scala REPL

## Installation

In your `build.sbt`

```
resolvers += "scala-stellar-sdk-repo" at "https://dl.bintray.com/synesso/mvn"

libraryDependencies +=  "stellar.scala.sdk" %% "scala-stellar-sdk" % "0.0.1.5"
```

## Examples

All of the following examples use the [Ammonite REPL](http://ammonite.io/). After launching `amm`, fetch and import the
Stellar SDK for Scala.

```
interp.repositories() ++= Seq(coursier.MavenRepository("https://dl.bintray.com/synesso/mvn/"))

import $ivy.`stellar.scala.sdk::scala-stellar-sdk:0.0.1.5`
import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global
import scala.concurrent._
import stellar.sdk._
import stellar.sdk.resp._
```

### Accounts

#### Creating and funding a test account

```
val kp = KeyPair.random
TestNetwork.fund(kp) // Future[FundTestAccountResp]
```

#### Checking the status of an account

```
TestNetwork.account(kp) // Future[AccountResp]
```

#### Fetch data for an account

```
TestNetwork.accountData(kp, "data_key") // Future[String]
```


### Assets

#### Fetching a stream of all assets

```
TestNetwork.assets // Future[Stream[AssetResp]]
```

#### Filtering assets by code or issuer, or both.

```
TestNetwork.assets(code = Some("ETH"))
TestNetwork.assets(issuer = Some("GAE325UC3T63ROIUFBBRNMWGM7AY2NI5C2YO55IPLRKCF3UECXLXKNNZ"))
TestNetwork.assets(code = Some("ETH"), issuer = Some("GAE325UC3T63ROIUFBBRNMWGM7AY2NI5C2YO55IPLRKCF3UECXLXKNNZ"))
```

### todo

* all txns require an account, so account can record the network it came from.
